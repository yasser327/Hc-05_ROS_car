# Hc-05_ROS_car
ros-serial via hc05
this is an attempt of me to apply what i learned about ros1 noetic , i connected an hc05 to my linux machine and set it as serial communicator between my pc and the RC car, therefore making the arduino a serial node via ros-serial, the car worked over console commands so nothing really fancy, this project is still on the making..
it has 2 l293d drivers, 5 motors, hc05, arduino, 12v battery source
i will definitely update this in the future since it's not complete yet.
